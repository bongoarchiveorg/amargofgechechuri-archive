Also kindly non ju folks who are deliberately going off about "gajakhor college" "politics eshob na toh ki hobe" it might be an institutional fault entirely I agree but moreover the fault cumulatively is ours because we have normalised this behavior primarily, we enabled it infact, "ragging na dadagiri" "chelemanush kora" we sculpted all this with our own hands and it's about time to take accountability and make ourselves better and that's what I believe really, we need to make sure no other kid ends up like Swapnodeep and that's my take for today
